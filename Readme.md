# Quotes, Forms, and Rest APIs

Today we are going to explore Forms, Cookies, and Rest APIs

### General

For today, we'll focus on frontend more than the backend. And we will do some manual testing ourselves as well.

### Frontend

- Run the frontend server by doing the following:
  - Open a terminal and navigate into the folder by running `cd quo-gen-web`
  - Install dependencies using `npm`
  - See the `package.json` to identify the command to run the server in `dev` mode.
- See the console/terminal on which url:port the app is being served at. Open that link in the browser.
- Run the end-to-end tests (if there are any) to make sure everything is working
  - `npm run e2e`
- Run the `lint` to see the code style is consistent/'
  - fix any issues that arise

### Backend

- You might get a CORS error in the frontend, if you haven't started the server. No need to dig deep into it, just make sure to start the backend `quo-gen-be` in `dev` mode.

### Use cases

Look at the e2e test cases for each page to understand what they are supposed to do.

### Edit code

Your task is to make the unit test pass by editing the actual code files. That means that you shall not touch the test files. I.e. the files ending with `*.spec.ts` or `*.test.ts`.

Congratulations!!! You have just completed the exercise :)

### Retrospective

Collect your team members and reflect over what you just did. What did you learn today?
